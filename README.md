# WildLands_Experiment1
10,000 WildLands Simulation Experiment, with results

Food Chain from top to bottom (Higher up can eat anything below it):
Tigers (t)
Cats (c)
Mice (m)
Bugs (b)
Food (.)

The higher up on the food chain, the more HP is needed to reproduce.
Eating increases HP.
Moving lowers HP.
An HP of zero, then the organism dies.
Last organism remaining is the 'winner' of the current simulation.
